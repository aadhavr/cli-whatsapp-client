Anaya is a command-line application to interact with WhatsApp via Terminal. This tool allows you to discreetly send and receive WhatsApp messages directly from your terminal.

I built this because I wanted to respond to my girlfriend's texts during work or class, discreetly. If I took out my phone or opened up WhatsApp on my laptop, I could get in trouble. I noticed that non-technical people's eyes just glaze over when you use a terminal, so this is a way for me to text her during 9-5 hours without anyone peering over my shoulder. Maybe it's helpful for you.
